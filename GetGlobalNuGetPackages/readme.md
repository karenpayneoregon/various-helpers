# About

This project goal is to show how a new developer or even a season developer can learn something new by working outside of their comfort zone. In this case the project works with a NuGet package that most developers more likely than not have never worked with and may or may not find useful but developers get to learn one or more new things.

**How to get**
- Cached NuGet packages from the global NuGet cache.
- Get NuGet package sources from the global NuGet configuration.

## Requires

:small_orange_diamond: NuGet package [NuGet.Configuration](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NuGet.Configuration/6.12.1?_src=template)

## NuGet documentation

If new to working with NuGet packages this is where to start learning.

[NuGet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/) is the package manager for .NET. It enables developers to create, share, and consume useful .NET libraries. NuGet client tools provide the ability to produce and consume these libraries as "packages".



## Microsoft Documentation for NuGet Client Tools

## Repo for NuGet Client issues

The [Home repository](https://github.com/nuget/Home) is the starting point for people to learn about NuGet, the project.
