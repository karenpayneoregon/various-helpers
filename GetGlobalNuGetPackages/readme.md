# About

This project goal is to show how a new developer or even a season developer can learn something new by working outside of their comfort zone. In this case the project works with a NuGet package that most developers more likely than not have never worked with and may or may not find useful but developers get to learn one or more new things.

**How to get**
- Cached NuGet packages from the global NuGet cache.
- Get NuGet package sources from the global NuGet configuration.

## Requires

- NuGet package [NuGet.Configuration](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NuGet.Configuration/6.12.1?_src=template)
- NuGet package [NuGet.Protocol](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NuGet.Protocol/6.12.1?_src=template)



## NuGet documentation

If new to working with NuGet packages this is where to start learning.

[NuGet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/) is the package manager for .NET. It enables developers to create, share, and consume useful .NET libraries. NuGet client tools provide the ability to produce and consume these libraries as "packages".



## Microsoft Documentation for NuGet Client Tools

- Found [here](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/tree/dev) along with other references.
- NuGet [Client SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuget-client-sdk)

## Repo for NuGet Client issues

The [Home repository](https://github.com/nuget/Home) is the starting point for people to learn about NuGet, the project.

## Project documentation

Used Jetbrains [AI assistant](https://www.jetbrains.com/ai/) to create the project documentation and in some cases modifed by hand.

Way too many developers fail to write documentation for their code, with either Jetbrains AI assistant or GitHub [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot?ocid=AIDcmmb150vbv1_SEM__k_Cj0KCQiApNW6BhD5ARIsACmEbkWFGYZBa2oHA-voKTZ4SL5l3zx0GnWAoQDelxS3VVFXxhV4TvBuyNEaAn4vEALw_wcB_k_) developers can now write documentation for their code with these tools, review, keep `as is` or `modify` to suit their needs.
